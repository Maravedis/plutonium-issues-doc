# Plutonium Issues Docs

This repository is an attempt to harmonize documentation on the issues [plutonium]() is facing with the down of [5eTools].

This documents will try to explain some solutions that you can implement, and point to some tools some generous people wrote.

## Overview and disclaimers

First, English is not my first language. I'll do my best but mistakes will sneak by. Sorry. Also, while I'm fairly knowledgeable about computers, I am unfamiliar with Windows and still a newcomer to plutonium and foundry in general. Don't hesitate to correct me if you spot mistakes.
