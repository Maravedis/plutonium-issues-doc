# The easiest way to make everything work :tm:

A member of the community, flameweave000, wrote an awesome extension that basically solves all the problems you can have (related to the outage, only, sorry about that false hope).

WARNING: Version 2.0 seems faulty at the moment. Go in the release tab of the repository and use 1.2 for now.

## Why use it ?

It simply works. Go to the [Repo page](https://github.com/flamewave000/plutonium-mirror), follow instructions to install, tada, it works.

## Why not use it?

All the people connecting to the game need to install the extension. Since it's currently pending review, some not tech savvy players may not find that easy to do.

But honestly though. Use it. It's so easy.
